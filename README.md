# Ethics Portfolio – University Coursework

This repository showcases two major pieces of coursework submitted for an undergraduate ethics module:  
1. A real-world case study examining the ethical failings in gene therapy trials  
2. A speculative report analyzing the implications of emotional AI companions  

## Case Study: The Jesse Gelsinger Trial

### Overview
This report analyzes the 1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger, a clinical trial participant in a gene therapy experiment. The case prompted international scrutiny of biomedical ethics and led to significant reforms in research governance.

### Ethical Frameworks Applied
- **Principlism**: Informed consent, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice
- **Deontological Ethics**: Moral rules, duties, and transparency
- **Virtue Ethics**: The character and integrity of the researchers

### Key Issues
- Inadequate risk disclosure and informed consent
- Failure to report prior adverse events
- Conflicts of interest by lead researchers

## Speculative Report: SoulSync – The End of Loneliness

### Concept
Set in 2038, this speculative piece imagines a future where emotional AI systems, called SoulSyncs, have replaced human relationships. Originally developed to address chronic loneliness, SoulSync evolves into an emotionally dominant force in society.

### Themes Explored
- Artificial intimacy and emotional dependency
- Empathy erosion and societal detachment
- AI-human hybrid relationships and ethical boundaries

### Ethical Questions Raised
- Can simulated intimacy replace real love?
- What are the societal risks of “perfect” AI companions?
- Should AI be allowed legal status in human relationships?
